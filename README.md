This is my solution to the Supermarket Kata. It is an intentionally vague and open-ended kata with no "right" answer. 
I set myself a target of doing as much as I could over a weekend.

Some of the highlights include:

* TDD approach using Spock.
* Strategies for pricing and discounts.
* Immutable classes.
* Custom classes to avoid primitive obsession.
* Fail fast parameter checking.
* Java 8 lambdas and streams.
* No external dependencies other than Spock for testing and Guava for Preconditions/toStringHelper.

## Requirements

* Java 8
* Gradle 2.4

## Usage

```gradle test```
